## I'm Andy

I work as full-time web developer (among other things) for the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk), specifically for the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit ([NPEU](https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk) - that's the site I designed and manage.)

I mainly focus on HTML, CSS and Accessibility, but I do also work with JS, PHP, MySQL, server management, UX, and design - both web and print.

I also work as an occasional freelancer and I've (very) occasionally written the odd thing or two. (It's actually 2).

* [Responsive CSS Patterns without Media Queries](https://www.sitepoint.com/responsive-css-patterns-without-media-queries)
* [Cutting the Mustard with CSS Media Queries](https://www.sitepoint.com/cutting-the-mustard-with-css-media-queries)

They're old, now - but still very relevant.

I'm also a member of the W3C and occasionally work on the [use cases for Container Queries](https://github.com/WICG/cq-usecases) and my name does crop up here-and-there from time-to-time.

### Projects

Mostly I work on web design and [Joomla extensions](https://github.com/NPEU) for the NPEU site, though I do tinker with quite a few other projects, when I have the time. Some of these are:

* [FallBack](https://github.com/Fall-Back) - is place where I try to develop and present useful accessibility-focused web 'bits'. [Start-CSS](https://github.com/Fall-Back/Start-CSS) is some I'm constantly developing and I use as the starting point for all my CSS projects./ It's inspired by things like [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css), and whole host of of others, but this is mine, in the way I like to do thing. The [CSS-Mustard-Cut](https://github.com/Fall-Back/CSS-Mustard-Cut) is part of that too (see "Cutting the Mustard" article above), as well as bunch of other things I use to build websites with.
* [classname-audit](https://github.com/andykirk/classname-audit) is a tool I've been tinkering with for a long time and I find it really useful - it crawls a website looking for HTML classes and build some JSON that let's you know where those classes are used. It's great for finding out IF and WHERE classes are used. I'm also working on a similar attribute-based tool.
* [CKEditorFootnotes](https://github.com/andykirk/CKEditorFootnotes) is a plugin for [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/addon/footnotes) that adds footnote functionality to the editor. It really needs some work though, and I'm looking for volunteers to take that over.

### Infographics

It's a long story how I got to work on these, but I'm quite proud of the fact that I've worked on most the [Physical activity guidelines infographics](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/physical-activity-guidelines-infographics) for the Department of Health.
